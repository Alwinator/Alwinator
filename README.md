# Hi, I'm Alwin 👋🏼

I am a student at HTL Spengergasse, specializing in computer science. In my free time I work on artificial intelligence and machine learning projects, as well as web applications associated with database structures.

Talk to me about [Singularity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_singularity), [Continuous Integration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration) and [Quantified Self](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantified_self). 🧠

I usually work on business projects on private GitLab servers. That's why I have few commits on GitHub.

### Around the web 🧭

I don't have Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat, Facebook, or TikTok. So, if you find random profiles through Google -- that's not me!
